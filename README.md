## Autism Detection: A Data-Driven Solution
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Need for Objective Screening: Machine learning can help create more consistent and objective early screening tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).


## About
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. 
Early diagnosis is critical for better outcomes. 
Why Autism Prediction?
The purpose of the Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning project is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop an automated system that can accurately predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in its early stages based on behavioral and developmental data. 

## Features
The project aims to achieve the following objectives
-Improve diagnostic accuracy
-Enhance efficiency and speed
-Enable early intervention
-Provide an accessible tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.


## Requirements
Operating System: 64-bit Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu.
Python Version: Python 3.8 or later.
Frameworks: TensorFlow (2.5+), PyTorch for deep learning; scikit-learn for traditional ML.
Data Libraries: Pandas, NumPy for data handling; Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization.
IDE: VSCode or Jupyter Notebook.
Version Control: Git for collaborative work.
Optional Deployment Tools: Flask/Django for web deployment, Docker for containerization.
Hardware: NVIDIA GPU (CUDA-enabled), 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended).
Additional Libraries: OpenCV for image handling, SHAP/LIME for model explainability, joblib for model saving.
